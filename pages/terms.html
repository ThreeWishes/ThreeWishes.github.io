<h3>2. Use License</h3>
<ol type="a">
 <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of Genie per device for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

     <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in Genie;</li>
     <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
     <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
   </ol>
 </li>
 <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Genie at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>

<h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>
<ol type="a">
 <li>The materials within Genie are provided on an 'as is' basis.

</ol>
<h3>4. Limitations</h3>
<p>In no event shall Genie or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use Genie, even if Genie or a Genie authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

Genie may make changes to the materials contained in Genie at any time without notice. However Genie does not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>
<h3>6. Links</h3>
<p>Genie has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its app and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Genie of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>
<h3>7. Modifications</h3>
<p>Genie may revise these terms of service for its app at any time without notice. By using Genie you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.</p>
